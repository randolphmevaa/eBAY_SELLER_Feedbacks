# Project 3: Community learning - Randolph MEVA'A

# EBAY SELLER
(This project, is about unsupervised learning on an online dataset.)

✅Introduction:

As cybernaut, we all face the digital evolution and tend to make online purchases. For this reason we analyzed for you based on one seller's feedbacks if that seller will provide you the best services because, customer satisfaction is our primary goal at eBay.

✅Description:

Based on the structure found, we will find the seller that will provide the best services for specific type of customers. As a customer, how do I get a recommended seller based on feedbacks?


✅Data Sources:

We used the last 542 feedbacks from an EBAY seller. Our main focus was feedbacks and these feedbacks were found by web scraping over several urls.

✅Numeric Approach:

We vectorized our feedbacks in two different ways (Tfidf Vectorizer, Count Vectorizer) in order to perform clusters by using the k-means and then visualize the effects in 3 figures.
